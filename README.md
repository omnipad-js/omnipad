> **Break the device barrier: Wrap any Web game for mobile with a single configuration.**

OmniPad is a **high-performance, headless** virtual input engine specifically designed for Web-based games (HTML5 Canvas, Ruffle Flash Emulator, Godot Web exports, etc.). 

It provides a comprehensive orchestration system that translates "Touch Gestures / Physical Gamepad Inputs" into "Native Browser Keyboard / Mouse Events." Without modifying a single line of your game's core source code, OmniPad empowers legacy web games with a native-mobile-like control experience.

## 🆚 Why OmniPad?
Most joystick libraries (like nipple.js) only provide raw UI and coordinate calculations. OmniPad is a **complete input adaptation layer**: We don't just provide the UI; we solve the "end-game" pain points of web game porting, such as **Shadow DOM isolation**, **browser focus loss**, and **multi-touch conflicts**.

## ✨ Core Architecture & Features

* 🚀 **Headless Design**: The input state machine, gesture recognition, and core scheduling are fully encapsulated in the zero-dependency `@omnipad/core`. It is natively framework-agnostic. We currently provide `@omnipad/vue`, a production-ready Vue 3 adapter.
* 🌲 **Flat Profile & Forest**: An innovative JSON parsing engine. It supports parsing a single flat configuration into multiple independent root nodes, allowing you to use native CSS Flex/Grid to build complex responsive layouts for both landscape and portrait modes.
* 👻 **Event Penetration & Focus Protection**: Features high-fidelity synthetic event routing that elegantly penetrates the Shadow DOM boundaries of WebAssembly emulators (like Ruffle). Built-in "Auto-Focus Reclaim" logic ensures keys never get stuck or unresponsive.
* 🎛️ **Touch-to-Spawn (Dynamic Mounting)**: Supports **spawning** joysticks or buttons anywhere in an `InputZone` upon touch. This perfectly mimics the control habits of modern mobile action games.
* ⚡️ **Performance First**: No expensive DOM reflows. All displacement calculations happen in memory, with hardware acceleration forced via `translate3d`. Built-in **rAF (requestAnimationFrame) throttling** ensures perfect synchronization with high-refresh-rate screens.
* 📐 **Responsive Unit Support**: The `LayoutBox` constraint system natively supports `px`, `%`, `vh/vw`, and other CSS units. Combined with a flexible **Anchor** system, a single configuration can adapt to everything from an iPhone SE to an iPad Pro.
* 🔌 **Input Fusion**: Managed by a unified underlying state machine, OmniPad supports simultaneous inputs from screen touch, mouse clicks, and **Physical Gamepads**, with real-time synchronized feedback on the virtual UI.

## 📦 Installation

Ensure you have Vue 3 installed in your project (`peerDependencies`).

```bash
npm install @omnipad/core @omnipad/vue
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Don't forget to import the base styles in your entry file (e.g., `main.ts` or `App.vue`): `import '@omnipad/vue/style.css';`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Pattern 1: Standalone Mode
Ideal for simple scenarios where you need to add fixed buttons to specific corners. No complex configuration required; just use them as standard UI components.

```vue
<script setup>
import { TargetZone, VirtualButton, VirtualJoystick } from '@omnipad/vue';
import '@omnipad/vue/style.css';
</script>

<template>
  <div class="game-container">
    <!-- Deploy an action button mapped to the W key -->
    <VirtualButton 
      label="JUMP"
      target-stage-id="$stage"
      :mapping="{ code: 'KeyW' }" 
      style="width: 80px; height: 80px; z-index: 100;" 
    />
    
    <!-- Deploy an analog stick with 360° cursor displacement -->
    <VirtualJoystick 
      :cursor-mode="true"
      :cursor-sensitivity="1.2"
      target-stage-id="$stage"
      :mapping="{ stick: { type: 'mouse', button: 0 } }" 
      :layout="{ bottom: '120px', left: '120px', width: '150px', height: '150px', zIndex: 100 }" 
    />

    <!-- Deploy a full-screen reception zone to handle simulated events -->
    <TargetZone 
      widget-id="$stage"
      cursor-enabled
      :layout="{ left: 0, top: 0, height: '100%', width: '100%' }"/>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Pattern 2: Data-Driven Mode
Recommended for complex applications. Define screen partitions (Zones) and all key mappings via a flat JSON profile. Use **RootLayer (or any OmniPad component)** as the root node to carry the parsed `ConfigTreeNode`.

**1. Define `profile.json`:**

```json
{
  "meta": { "name": "Action Layout" },
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "$ui-layer",
      "type": "root-layer"
    },
    {
      "id": "$game-canvas",
      "type": "target-zone",
      "parentId": "$ui-layer",
      "config": {
        "cursorEnabled": true,
        "layout": { "left": 0, "top": 0, "height": "100%", "width": "100%" }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "movement",
      "type": "d-pad",
      "parentId": "$ui-layer",
      "config": {
        "mapping": { 
          "up": { "code": "ArrowUp" },
          "down": { "code": "ArrowDown" },
          "left": { "code": "ArrowLeft" },
          "right": { "code": "ArrowRight" }
        }, 
        "layout": { "left": "10%", "bottom": "20%", "height": "20%", "isSquare": true }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "btn-fire",
      "type": "button",
      "parentId": "$ui-layer",
      "config": {
        "label": "FIRE",
        "mapping": { "code": "Space" }, 
        "layout": { "right": "10%", "bottom": "20%", "height": "10%", "isSquare": true }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Parse and Render in Vue:**
```vue
<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue';
import { parseProfileJson, parseProfileTrees } from '@omnipad/core/utils';
import { RootLayer } from '@omnipad/vue';
import profileRaw from './profile.json';

// Analyze flat configuration and build the runtime component forest
const forest = computed(() => parseProfileTrees(parseProfileJson(profileRaw)));
</script>

<template>
  <div class="viewport">
    <!-- Player element, replace with Ruffle / H5 player -->
    <canvas id="my-game"></canvas>
    <!-- Upon receiving the root node, the engine will automatically generate the entire interactive interface through recursion. -->
    <RootLayer
      class="ui-layer" 
      v-if="forest.roots['$ui-layer']"
      :tree-node="forest.roots['$ui-layer']" />
  </div>
</template>

<style>
.viewport, #my-game, .ui-layer {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
```

## 🕹️ Advanced: Gamepad API Integration

Want to use an Xbox or PlayStation controller? Simply add a mapping table. OmniPad automatically handles controller polling. When you press a physical button, the corresponding virtual button on the screen will **synchronously trigger** its press animation, providing perfect haptic feedback.

```typescript
import { GamepadManager } from '@omnipad/core';

// Start global physical gamepad monitoring
GamepadManager.getInstance().setConfig(forest.value.runtimeGamepadMappings);
GamepadManager.getInstance().start();
```
```json
// Add a mapping array at the root of profile.json:
"gamepadMappings":[
  {
    "buttons": { "A": "movement", "RT": "btn-fire" },
    "leftStick": "my-joystick"
  }
]
```
> *💡 Tip: Supports array-based mapping for Local Co-op scenarios! Player 1 and Player 2 can play together without interference.*

## 🛠️ Advanced Customization

OmniPad’s core philosophy is **"Logic Closed, UI Open."**

### 1. CSS Theming
The library separates layout from style. The `layout` property handles physical coordinates, while visual aesthetics are managed by CSS variables.
```css
/* Modify the global theme */
:root {
  --omnipad-btn-bg: rgba(0, 255, 100, 0.2);
  --omnipad-btn-border: 2px solid #00ff6a;
}

/* Use the className field in config for specific button styles */
.danger-btn {
  --omnipad-btn-bg: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.4);
}
```

### 2. Factory Extension
You can write your own custom components and **register them into the parsing engine** seamlessly.
```typescript
import { registerComponent } from '@omnipad/vue';
import CustomTrackpad from './components/CustomTrackpad.vue';

// Register the custom component as 'custom-trackpad'
registerComponent('custom-trackpad', CustomTrackpad);
```
After registration, you can directly use `"type": "custom-trackpad"` in your JSON configuration. The engine will automatically instantiate and bind the Core logic for you.
